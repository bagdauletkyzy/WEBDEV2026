            Music has always been the place where I feel most myself. It’s strange, because when you’re in front of thousands of people, you’d think it’s the scariest moment. But for me, it’s the opposite. On stage, I feel safe. I feel like I can be honest in ways I can’t in everyday life. Writing songs late at night, when the world is quiet, is like therapy. I pour out the things I don’t know how to say to anyone else. Sometimes those words are dark, sometimes they’re fragile, but they’re always real. Fame makes you feel exposed, like everyone is watching every move. But when I hear fans singing back lyrics I wrote in my bedroom, I realize I’m not alone. That’s the magic of music — it connects us in ways nothing else can.

        <p>People always talk about my clothes, my hair, my “look.” Oversized hoodies, baggy pants, neon colors — they became part of my identity. But it wasn’t about fashion trends. It was about freedom. I never wanted to be defined by how my body looked. I wanted people to listen to my voice, my words, my art. Dressing the way I do gave me control over how I’m seen. And honestly, it gave me peace. Style is personal. It’s not about pleasing others, it’s about protecting yourself and expressing who you are. If my choices inspire someone else to feel comfortable in their own skin, then that’s the best outcome I could ask for.

            There are days when I feel invisible, and days when I feel too seen. Anxiety is something I’ve lived with for a long time, and it doesn’t just disappear because you’re successful. Sometimes it feels heavier because the world expects you to be strong all the time. But I’ve learned that being open about it helps. When I write about fear, loneliness, or heartbreak, I know someone out there is feeling the same. And when they tell me my music made them feel less alone, it makes me feel less alone too. That’s the connection I live for.
